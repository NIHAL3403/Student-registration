Student Registration System

Project Overview

The Student Registration System is a web application designed to allow users to register student details, view a list of registered students, and perform operations such as editing or deleting student records. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and leverages the browser's local storage to persist data across sessions.

Key Features
Student Registration Form: Allows users to input student details such as name, ID, email, and contact number.
Student Records Display: Displays a list of registered students in a table format.
Edit and Delete Functionality: Provides options to edit existing records and delete unwanted records.
Persistent Storage: Uses local storage to save student data, ensuring that records remain even after the page is refreshed.
Enhanced User Experience: Includes modern styling, animations, and smooth transitions for a better user experience.
Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS3: For styling the application and adding visual effects.
JavaScript : For implementing functionality, including form validation, local storage management, and dynamic content rendering.
File Structure

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
styles.css: The CSS file responsible for styling the form, table, and other elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file handling form submissions, data validation, local storage operations, and UI interactions.
Detailed Breakdown

1. index.html
The index.html file provides the skeleton of the application. It includes:

A header with the application title and a brief description.
A form for student registration with fields for the student name, ID, email, and contact number.
A section for displaying registered student records in a table format.
References to the external CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript (script.js) files.

2. styles.css
The styles.css file enhances the visual appeal of the application through:

Responsive Layout: Ensures the application looks good on different screen sizes.
Modern Design: Uses a gradient background, semi-transparent form elements, and smooth hover effects.
Animations: Includes fade-in animations for the header, form, and student records table to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

3. script.js
The script.js file manages the application's functionality:

Form Handling: Listens for form submissions and validates the input data.
Data Validation: Ensures that the form fields are correctly filled out before allowing submission.
Local Storage Management: Stores and retrieves student data from the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
Dynamic UI Updates: Renders the list of registered students dynamically and updates the UI when records are added, edited, or deleted.
Animations: Adds smooth fade-in effects to newly added rows in the student records table.
How to Use the Application

1. Adding a Student
Fill out the form with the student's name, ID, email, and contact number.
Click the "Register Student" button to add the student to the list.
The student will appear in the table below the form.
2. Editing a Student
Click the "Edit" button next to a student's record in the table.
The student's details will populate the form fields, allowing you to make changes.
Submit the form again to save the updates.
3. Deleting a Student
Click the "Delete" button next to a student's record in the table.
The student will be removed from both the table and local storage.
4. Persistent Data
All registered student records are stored in the browser's local storage.
Data persists even after refreshing the page or closing and reopening the browser.
Implementation Details

Form Validation
The application includes robust form validation:

Student Name: Must contain only alphabetic characters and spaces.
Student ID: Must be a numeric value.
Email ID: Must follow the standard email format (e.g., example@domain.com).
Contact No: Must be a numeric value.
Local Storage
The student data is stored in local storage as a JSON string.
When the page loads, the displayStudents function retrieves the data from local storage and populates the student records table.
Animations
Fade-In Effects: Used for the header, form, and student records table to create a smooth loading experience.
Row Animation: Newly added rows in the table have a fade-in effect, improving the visual feedback for users.
Conclusion

The Student Registration System provides a simple yet effective way to manage student records through a web interface. The combination of modern design, client-side data persistence, and user-friendly interactions makes this application a solid example of a small-scale web project.
